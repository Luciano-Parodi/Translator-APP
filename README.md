# Translator - APP
### A Web Translator Application

## Overview
This is a simple __Translator App__ built as a learning project to understand how to work with __APIs__, specifically focusing on integrating a third-party translation API. The app allows users to input text, select source and target languages, and receive the translated text in real-time.

This project is designed for educational purposes and serves as a practical example of how to:

* Make HTTP requests using Axios.
* Handle API responses and errors.
* Dynamically update the DOM using JavaScript.
* Use modern web development tools like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).

## Technologies Used
__Frontend:__
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

__API:__
* Text Translator API (via RapidAPI)

__HTTP Client:__
* Axios for making API requests.

## How It Works
* __User Input:__ The user enters text in the input field and selects the source and target languages.

* __API Request:__ When the "Translate" button is clicked, the app sends a POST request to the Text Translator API with the input text and selected languages.

* __API Response:__ The API processes the request and returns the translated text.

* __Display Result:__ The translated text is displayed on the screen, preserving any line breaks or formatting.
